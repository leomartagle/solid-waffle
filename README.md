# Undergrad Python Projecs

ðŸ“˜ Mathematical Computation 1 Projects (Undergraduate Work)
This repository contains Python codes I developed as part of my Mathematical Computation 1 course during my undergraduate studies. The scripts cover foundational topics such as numerical methods, equation solving, matrix operations, interpolation, and basic calculus applications. Each project demonstrates how computational techniques can be applied to solve mathematical problems efficiently using Python.
